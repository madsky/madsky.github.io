      <description>This was a test post for a while, until I figured out Hugo and Github Pages. I think it&amp;rsquo;s testament to how oddly difficult it has become for me to learn new thing that this has taken me a long time when all the tutorials seem so straightforward. And yet, when I looked for video tutrials so that I could actually watch people doing it &amp;lsquo;live&amp;rsquo;, it seemed like the vast majoroty of those people were just winging it too.</description>
