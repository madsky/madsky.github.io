				<h1 class="post__title">First</h1>
				<div class="post__content"><p>This was a test post for a while, until I figured out Hugo and Github Pages.  I think it&rsquo;s testament to how oddly difficult it has become for me to learn new thing that this has taken me a long time when all the tutorials seem so straightforward.  And yet, when I looked for video tutrials so that I could actually watch people doing it &lsquo;live&rsquo;, it seemed like the vast majoroty of those people were just winging it too.</p>

<p>Anyway, now I have a blog, which is maybe 50% of the problem solved.  The other 50% being something to write about.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve previously blogged about infosec, but that tends to bore me nowadays.  The reality of infosec versus the perception, or the intention, is something I don&rsquo;t feel like whitewashing anymore.  If you want to read some of my previous infosec musings they&rsquo;re on <a href="https://www.securitybytes.io">Security Bytes</a>.  Perhaps I&rsquo;ll spend some time calling out some of the unspoken truths about infosec.  That might be fun.  Or cathartic, maybe.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also considered that this might be my personal alternative to social media.  I have an abusive relationship with social media, in general.  I realised I was unable to tolerate the flagrant abuse of Facebook any longer and so deleted my account there a long time ago.  That one was easy, as it turns out.  I don&rsquo;t miss it at all.  Twitter, on the other hand, I find moves in cycles in my head.  Sometimes I manage to maintain some level of irreverence around it and use it like Jack wants to pretend everyone does - for finding out what&rsquo;s happening and &lsquo;being part of the conversation&rsquo;.  But as that veneer wears off I quickly find the Emperor has no clothes and see Twitter for hate-fuelled, rabble-rousing, race to the bottom that rewards outrage, sub-division, and mob justice.  And so I delete everything I ever tweeted, go into hiding for a while, and wait for my malaise to pass over.  Only during this latest down cycle I haven&rsquo;t felt the pull to return yet.</p>

<p>There is also my perrenial desire to rediscover my previously-held love of learning.  I can pinpoint where that died (maybe I&rsquo;ll blog about that one day), but the sad truth is that I haven&rsquo;t been able to get back on the learning horse for quite some time.  One thing this might become is a directory of tutorials for things I&rsquo;ve learned how to do.  That&rsquo;d be nice, but I&rsquo;m not committing to anything.</p>

<p>Finally, it can&rsquo;t have escaped anyone&rsquo;s attention that the world has taken a stark new direction over the past few years.  And almost none of it is good.  But I can&rsquo;t find much in the middle of the maelstrom that represents hope.  One side of the spectrum has emerged, newly emboldened and appears to be working to dismantle reason, tradition, and sense.  The other side can&rsquo;t determine who it dislikes most - its enemies, or its allies who, it turns out, eat their eggs slightly differently than they do - and so we watch as everyone pulls further away from consensus and reason, leaving a gaping void where the middle used to be.  Surely there are still people in the middle who can reason, debate, discuss, disagree, and understand without resorting to punching each other or finding a new radical departure from a norm to rally around instead of making progress?</p>

<p>So what?  Well, nothing actually.</p>

<p>Who am I?  No one, as it happens.</p>

<p>I just might have things to say that might be worth reading.  I make no promises.</p>
