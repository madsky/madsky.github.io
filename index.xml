      <description>Jordan Peterson has become something of an anti-hero in modern woke culture, ostensibly through his refusal to bow to trans folks&amp;rsquo; demands to refer to them by a series of invented pronouns according to their preference.</description>

      <description>Mainstream media, primarily print media, has been very visibly struggling for a long time at the hands of the Internet. I&amp;rsquo;d written it off as an anachronism and for the most part celebrated the demise of trash journalism.</description>

      <description>I make no effort to hide the fact that I think Sam Harris is brilliant, and I&amp;rsquo;m more than happy to bend anyone&amp;rsquo;s ear about why if they&amp;rsquo;re unsure.</description>

      <description>I quite often find myself torn over how much entertainment to prescribe for my kids. I remember as a kid that entertainment was &amp;ldquo;going playing out&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Meditation has been a topic that&amp;rsquo;s interested me for a while. I think it was probably Sam Harris who first brought it to my serious attention through his (as was) &amp;ldquo;Waking Up Podcast&amp;rdquo; - now &amp;ldquo;Making Sense Podcast&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>The idea of reading an overview and teardown of the British judicial system sounds like it might be amongst the most niche forms of self-flagellation one might explore, but the author&amp;rsquo;s Twitter presence convinced me that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be an arid, academic exercise in pedantry, so I gave it a shot.</description>

      <description>I will post no spoilers here.
Difficult to know where to begin with this one. It&amp;rsquo;s an uneven mix of compelling character drama, action thriller, 80&amp;rsquo;s nostalgia, and sci-fi and it deals with each of these things very differently and with different levels of success.</description>

      <description>This has sat as a test post for a while whilst I figured out how to make a blog using Hugo and Github Pages. The fact that this has taken me as long as it has only serves to demonstrate to me how I seem to be losing grasp of technology.</description>
