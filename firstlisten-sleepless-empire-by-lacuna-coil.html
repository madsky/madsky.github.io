I listened to the pre-release songs and was excited for where it was going. I've also been watching their hype on socials around filming for the release.</p><p>I tend to only graze pre-release singles because I feel like they're lacking the context of the album. I imagine it's a tricky game to pick your pre-release too - you want something that you consider to be one of the better tracks so you can showcase what you've done, but you don't want to release yourÂ <em>best</em> tracks because it should only be whetting the appetite.</p><p>Without the full album wrapper it feels lost to me, and so I wait.</p><p>Yesterday I gave this its first full spin. Admittedly in the car with other people, so it didn't have my full attention. But my day hadn't allowed a gap to listen properly and I wasn't going to not play it on release date!</p><p>My very high level first pass is that this is going to be awesome.</p><p>Christina's vocals are on point - as are Andrea's new heavier death growls that we got to enjoy on Comalies XX. The compositions sound interesting - soaring sections, brutal passages, and strong interplay. The mix sounds fuller with more presence from the guitars and rhythm section. It feels like they're back to courting a more alt/metal fanbase whereas some of their previous outtings felt like they were aimed at people with more of a pop sensibility in their structures.</p><p>I have the vinyl on order from my local record shop so I'm looking forward to a more detailed listen once that pops up, but in the meantime this is a record I'll be spending a bunch of time with. I'm sincerely hoping that this has a reception similar to, or better than, Comalies had for them back in 2002.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on Saturday, 15 February 2025</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://madsky.github.io/tags/album-review/">Album Review</a></li><li><a href="https://madsky.github.io/tags/music/">Music</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://madsky.github.io/media/website/author.png" loading="lazy" alt="Leigh"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://madsky.github.io/authors/leigh/" class="invert" rel="author">Leigh</a></h3><p>Father, Husband, Guitar player, Piano-learner, Xbox-player, Metal-listener, infosec leader WIP.</p></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://madsky.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://madsky.github.io/link-blog-why-blog-if-nobody-reads-it.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Link Blog: Why Blog If Nobody Reads It</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://madsky.github.io/firstlisten-bioluminescence-by-dawn-of-ouroboros.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> #FirstListen Bioluminescence by Dawn of Ouroboros </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://madsky.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-03-08T10:26" class="feed__date">Saturday, 8 March 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://madsky.github.io/firstlisten-bioluminescence-by-dawn-of-ouroboros.html" class="invert">#FirstListen Bioluminescence by Dawn of Ouroboros</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-01-25T14:41" class="feed__date">Saturday, 25 January 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://madsky.github.io/firstlisten-passages-ep-by-sunrot.html" class="invert">#FirstListen: Passages EP by Sunrot</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://madsky.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
