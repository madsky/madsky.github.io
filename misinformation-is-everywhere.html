Basically any right wing press outlet is touting a version of it. And the worst of it comes from Russia-backed "news" sources.</p><p>What's not acknoweldged - at least not in foaming-at-the-mouth headlines - is the nuance that actually makes clear that this is nonsense. Very carefully editorialised, close to the truth, nonsense.</p><p>The FT does a great job of avoiding the controversy and just reporting it straight <a href="https://on.ft.com/423oWNU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Sadly this is behind a paywall. So the sober, accurate understanding of what went on has to be paid for. The rabble-rousing consistently-wide-of-the-mark version is free to all comers.</p><p>So the reality of the above editorial line is actually:</p><ul><li>"Starmer had been director of public prosecutions for nine months when the decision was taken [not to prosecute Rochdale related grooming allegations]. <em>No evidence suggests he was made aware of the details of the case at the time</em>." <br><ul><li>From the above-linked FT article, my emphasis</li></ul></li><li>“Keir left in 2013, the CPS having gone from being dire at doing sex-abuse cases to having the highest conviction rate in our history. That wouldn’t have been possible without the support, resources and the protection I was given by Keir, at a time when it would have been easier to give up.”<ul><li>Nazir Afzal, chief prosecutor for the north west, from the same FT article</li></ul></li><li>Jess Phillips refused a new national enquiry - because there was one in 2015 which cost £180m, the recommendations from which are still unimplemented. Who was in power in 2015, out of interest?</li><li>Labour are supporting a local enquiry - as was conducted in Telford and Rotherham.</li></ul><p>Like I said, close to the truth, but wide of the mark.</p><p>But where is this all coming from?</p><p>It's no secret that the press in the UK is heavily right-leaning. The right will decry the "liberal media" but there are only a handful of sources of liberal mainstream media, with every other mainstream source solidly on the right.</p><p>And as we find ourselves with the first Labour government in 14 years - with the Conservative party in active meltdown, challenged from Farage, Musk, et al - there's a frantic drive to discredit everything Labour says (or doesn't say), or does (or doesn't do).</p><p>I do wonder if there's something more pernicious beneath it all, but it feels like I'd be going down a rabbit hole that is going to need much more time and research so I'm leaving this alone for now.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on Monday, 6 January 2025</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://madsky.github.io/tags/life/">Life</a></li><li><a href="https://madsky.github.io/tags/news/">News</a></li><li><a href="https://madsky.github.io/tags/politics/">politics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://madsky.github.io/media/website/author.png" loading="lazy" alt="Leigh"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://madsky.github.io/authors/leigh/" class="invert" rel="author">Leigh</a></h3><p>Father, Husband, Guitar player, Piano-learner, Xbox-player, Metal-listener, infosec leader WIP.</p></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://madsky.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://madsky.github.io/top-gigs-of-2024.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Top Gigs of 2024</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://madsky.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
