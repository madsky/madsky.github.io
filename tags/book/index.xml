      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the night before I go back to work following 3 weeks off.

      <description>Jordan Peterson has become something of an anti-hero in modern woke culture, ostensibly through his refusal to bow to trans folks&amp;rsquo; demands to refer to them by a series of invented pronouns according to their preference.</description>
