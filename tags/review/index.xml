      <description>I make no effort to hide the fact that I think Sam Harris is brilliant, and I&amp;rsquo;m more than happy to bend anyone&amp;rsquo;s ear about why if they&amp;rsquo;re unsure.</description>

      <description>The idea of reading an overview and teardown of the British judicial system sounds like it might be amongst the most niche forms of self-flagellation one might explore, but the author&amp;rsquo;s Twitter presence convinced me that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be an arid, academic exercise in pedantry, so I gave it a shot.</description>

      <description>I will post no spoilers here.
Difficult to know where to begin with this one. It&amp;rsquo;s an uneven mix of compelling character drama, action thriller, 80&amp;rsquo;s nostalgia, and sci-fi and it deals with each of these things very differently and with different levels of success.</description>
