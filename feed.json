I initially thought I was just getting some more run-of-the-mill doomy noise, but I was wrong. </p>\n<p>I love the vocal mix and tracking. It reminds me of what Absent In Body did with Plague God: it sort of feels like I'm being yelled at by a god. It's massive and charts the perfect course of how I think metal vocals should sound.</p>\n<p>When you arrive at the masterpiece of this EP, Untethered, you immediately know you're in for a treat. The guitars weave out a bleak, sober tapestry before everything kicks in and the bass starts driving the most beautiful, pulsing undercurrent. And to top it off we get the pained screams interplaying with a chanted melody that makes you give it your full attention.</p>\n<p>The opening track, Death Knell, threatened that \"there is no life in the void, only death\" - they then went on to prove over this short EP that there most certainly is life here and whilst it's awash with anguish, there's aching beauty too if you pay close enough attention.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to getting to know this band a lot more.</p>",

Sadly this is behind a paywall. So the sober, accurate understanding of what went on has to be paid for. The rabble-rousing consistently-wide-of-the-mark version is free to all comers.</p>\n<p>So the reality of the above editorial line is actually:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Starmer had been director of public prosecutions for nine months when the decision was taken [not to prosecute Rochdale related grooming allegations]. <em>No evidence suggests he was made aware of the details of the case at the time</em>.\" <br>\n<ul>\n<li>From the above-linked FT article, my emphasis</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>“Keir left in 2013, the CPS having gone from being dire at doing sex-abuse cases to having the highest conviction rate in our history. That wouldn’t have been possible without the support, resources and the protection I was given by Keir, at a time when it would have been easier to give up.”\n<ul>\n<li>Nazir Afzal, chief prosecutor for the north west, from the same FT article</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Jess Phillips refused a new national enquiry - because there was one in 2015 which cost £180m, the recommendations from which are still unimplemented. Who was in power in 2015, out of interest?</li>\n<li>Labour are supporting a local enquiry - as was conducted in Telford and Rotherham.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like I said, close to the truth, but wide of the mark.</p>\n<p>But where is this all coming from?</p>\n<p>It's no secret that the press in the UK is heavily right-leaning. The right will decry the \"liberal media\" but there are only a handful of sources of liberal mainstream media, with every other mainstream source solidly on the right.</p>\n<p>And as we find ourselves with the first Labour government in 14 years - with the Conservative party in active meltdown, challenged from Farage, Musk, et al - there's a frantic drive to discredit everything Labour says (or doesn't say), or does (or doesn't do).</p>\n<p>I do wonder if there's something more pernicious beneath it all, but it feels like I'd be going down a rabbit hole that is going to need much more time and research so I'm leaving this alone for now.</p>",

Wayfarer - Brudenell Social Club, Leeds</p>\n<p>It will come as no surprise that in a year when Wayfarer were touring my favourite gig that year was going to be Wayfarer. I've been obsessed with these guys for over a decade and last year when I finally got to see them live was amazing.</p>\n<p>This year they were back with another album and a much extended touring schedule.</p>\n<p>As we were queueing to get in I noticed that some of the band were getting changed in a van right next to us. It sheds a light on how unglamourous an industry this can be that these guys from Denver, Colorado who are touring Europe basically live out of the back of a Transit van for the duration.</p>\n<p>I chatted with Jamie (bass, vocals) and Joey (lead guitar) for a few minutes before their set - given the pedestal I hold these guys up on, it still amazes me to this day that they're just chilling at the back of the venue and I can wander up and say hi.</p>\n<p>The sound mix at Brudenell was incredible. My favourite sound set-up by a long-shot. Wayfarer played a relatively short set (opening for Svalbard and Enslaved) but covered a lot of ground from their new record. </p>\n<p>It was at this gig that I really came to realise just how much work Joey is putting in on lead throughout the songs. On the surface the songs have a nice set of riffs and breaks, but when you get the mix right (and you can see him playing it!) you realise that the texture beneath those riffs is a rich tapestry.</p>\n<p>Afterwards I was waiting for my mate Paul in the corridor and Shane (guitar, vocals) came walking out and recognised me from the previous year in Manchester! We chatted for a while and he was joined by Joey before they headed out for some food. Last year I was a bit deer-in-the-headlights starstruck when I met them, but this year I almost managed to come across as a normal human.</p>\n<p>Great gig. Great band. Great venue.</p>\n<p>2. Tool - AO Arena, Manchester</p>\n<p>I'd given up hope of getting tickets for the show when I'd logged on and seen that they were going for £300+ each. I like Tool a lot, but I also like paying my mortgage. Eventually though, for some reason, a batch of more reasonably priced tickets came available - albeit sat up in the Gods - and I managed to snag a couple of me and Marc.</p>\n<p>We knew how high up the arena we were so I don't think we were expecting too much but incredibly the seats were pretty much perfect. More or less central at the back, we got a great spot for the spectacular light show that accompanied the gig.</p>\n<p>Tool were tight and machine-like as you'd expect. Given the complexity of what they do musically they alwasys amaze me.</p>\n<p>It seemed like there were two different entities on stage though - Maynard James Keenan, and then the band. Whilst this had no discernable impact on the music they played, save for a perfunctory coming-together at the end of the set they seemed comfortable in being separate. The band all hugged it out and thanked the crowd whereas MJK thanked everyone and left the band to enjoy their applause.</p>\n<p>This gig helped me towards the realisation that I'm not really a 'stadium tour' kind of concert go-er anymore. Amazing as they were, being one of 50,000 or so just seems a bit empty. I don't begrudge them (or anyone else) their success at being able to fill venues like this, but I don't think they're for me anymore.</p>\n<p>Still, amazing band, clinical execution, and a fantastic gig.</p>\n<p>3. Lacuna Coil - Academy, Manchester</p>\n<p>I was never a part of the goth scene back in the day. I was more traditional metal - jeans and t-shirt kind of guy, whereas the goth scene seemed a bit higher maintenance, fashion-wise. We used to pop in to the 'goth room' in Jilly's occasionally and whilst you'd occasionally get some real bangers in there, it always felt like it was someone else's room and you should get back to the warm beer and moshing in the main room.</p>\n<p>Lacuna Coil were one of the bands that did enter fairly regular rotation for me back then, and Comalies in particular (their breakthrough album) became a solid favourite for me.</p>\n<p>Weirdly in all the time since then I'd never seen them live, which is a bit weird when I think about it, so when the opportunity came to go see them with Russell I jumped at it.</p>\n<p>And what a gig it was too. The band were tight and heavy and Andrea and Cristina were absolutely incredible. I'm pretty sure Cristina is in her fifties now but she was absolutely belting out the tunes and made it look effortless.</p>\n<p>With the re-issue of Comalies as the heavier, slightly re-imagined, Comalies XX their sound has taken on a more modern metal edge and it works.</p>\n<p>A really high energy gig with really big nostalgia value for me. I'm looking forward to seeing them again next year when they drop their new album.</p>\n<p>4. Wayfarer - Club Academy, Manchester</p>\n<p>Back in the day, Club Academy was my venue of choice. I saw post-metal masters Isis there a long time ago and the sound was unrivaled. So I was really looking forward to catching Wayfarer here to bring it home.</p>\n<p>Phil came with me to this one - fair to say that he wasn't 'a fan' going into the gig but was pretty impressed and enjoyed it.</p>\n<p>Whilst the band played another great set (Leeds was the night before!) I felt like the venue let them down a bit. Joey was hidden in the mix and the clean vocals from Shane were too low as well.</p>\n<p>Ultimately it didn't make a jot of difference for me as I was in my element rocking out nonetheless!</p>\n<p>It was much more apparent when listening to Enslaved later on. Whereas at Brudenell their rhythm section was clear and tight, here it was muddy and ill-defined. A shame really.</p>\n<p>Phil and I bumped into the guys from Wode and had a chat with them. They were putting up Wayfarer for the past couple of nights in the area. They'd opened for Wayfarer last yeat at the Star and Garter. Turns out - which I'd totally forgotten - that when we, Omens, played our gig a decade earlier we were actually opening for Wode! Small world and I'm officially just 1 degree of separation away from Wayfarer!</p>\n<p>5. Torpor - Peer Hat, Manchester</p>\n<p>I'd not heard of Torpor before this gig and I was invited along by Phil. It's weird because having listened to them now, they fit nicely in my post-metal / sludge tastes, and I think I would have enjoyed them a lot.</p>\n<p>I'm writing in the past tense because this was the 'farewell' tour of the Bristol trio.</p>\n<p>The Peer Hat is a venue I'd never heard of either. A tiny pub with a basement in the back of the Northern Quarter. It didn't look like it could really hold a crowd.</p>\n<p>As we left the gig we talked about the reality of the metal scene, particularly with bands playing in niche genres like Torpor. For their farewell tour, after a decade or more at it, they only turned out about 30 people in Manchester. But I guess that is the gig - if you're playing for money and fame then you're probably best not focusing on 'existential sludge/post doom' and maybe looking at weddings and parties instead.</p>\n<p>These guys were clearly doing it for the love of the magnificent noise they were creating. And to be honest, if I could turn out 30 people interested in listening to me play the noise I'd created then I'd be pretty chuffed too. Even if it meant I had to get up for work the next morning.</p>",

Bravo, me!</p>\n<p>In reality, I was so invested in the Wayfarer hype train as a result of them putting out two stunning records in succession that I went out and bought them both on Vinyl. This was an odd move considering that I didn't have any means to play Vinyl. And so I decided to look into getting a hi-fi set up of my own. This took many months of research and talking to the local record shop owner. He shared with me his \"pitch\" for why someone should listen to Vinyl on a proper hi-fi set up (he was fully aware of his vested interest in his tale) and it was this: Vinyl forces us to <em>actively</em> listen to the music (because you need to flip the record every 20-or-so minutes) and so you can't really end up <em>grazing</em> the music. The packaging with Vinyl tends to come with a reasonable liner/content that you get yourself fully immersed as you listen.</p>\n<p>I was sold going in. And double sold coming out.</p>\n<p>So, here I am with a reasonable hi-fi but a pretty limited Vinyl collection so far. Now, the reality is that I'm not going to have hundreds of records overnight and exclusively listen to Vinyl since I have Apple Music and access to my whole listening history.</p>\n<p>But I've been able to carve out what I think will prove to be one of the most important parts of this process: the active listening.</p>\n<p>I've started following various reviewers and talking to old friends about music recommendations and have found myself carving out time to listen rather than it just being secondary to something else I'm doing (walking the dog, driving somewhere).</p>\n<p>There's an experiential element to listening on a real hi-fi that isn't there on headphones. I have some reasonable noise-cancelling in-ear headphones which represented a massive step-up from where I was, but listening with speakers, in a dedicated space, with a decent amp just hits different. The combination of the moving air and the fact that I'm there solely to experience this ~hour of music has made it beautiful.</p>\n<p>I've always loved music. I've always listened, but it's become such a passive, mindless activity that I quickly came to realise: I've really missed actively listening to a record.</p>\n<p>Here's to a year of new music and headspace.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I have spent a lot of time on Twitter, but it's fair to say I never really liked it. In fact, over the years I developed a love/hate relationship with it where I was either over-using it or deleting everything I'd ever done on there.</p>\n<p>In some ways it was useful at times - the infosec community was pretty strong on there, for example - but even as a part of that community twitter always left me feeling like an outsider looking in.</p>\n<p>Most often I found myself doom-scrolling following a world event that had annoyed me. It was at least good for getting breaking news or between-the-lines commentary on things.</p>\n<p>The worst of it was where I would find myself getting annoyed at things that didn't even really affect me. They weren't necessarily even \"bad\" either in my judgement. Just that some group was up against some other group over an issue and the resulting fall-out was polarising and, I guess, exciting.</p>\n<p>When Space Karen took over twitter I was not hopeful. I had been away from the site for some time but the Conservative party hilarity in the UK had brought me back to observe the insanity. However, following the attack on Paul Pelosi and the subsequent \"there may be more to this\" post, I'd had enough. US media is already a shambolic, divisive wasteland and this arsehole wading in with this moronic opinion, from such a position of influence was the last straw for me. And so I deleted my account.</p>\n<p>So where to next?</p>\n<p>There are plenty of other sites and communities vying for a piece of the crumbling twitter empire, but I recalled that I'd signed up a few years previous to a Mastodon community. I figured I could do worse than give that another go.</p>\n<p>In the past, Mastodon had felt like a bit of a ghost town. There were a few people on there, some who posted quite a lot, but overall it felt like a bit of a fringe, hobbyist affair.</p>\n<p>I dusted off my creds and dived back in.</p>\n<p>The whole place was alive! I saw a post recently saying that Mastodon (as a federated series of communities) was now over 8 million people strong. This has been growing steadily over the past few weeks. Certainly compared to the Mastodon community I was a part of a few years back it's a very different beast.</p>\n<p>In a different site I posted that Mastodon felt like a lost internet from the 90s. Interesting, quirky, friendly people going about their business and being nice to each other.</p>\n<p>In a few short weeks I've rediscovered music as a source of joy - through exploring recommendations of others and reading their reviews. I've found that over the Covid lockdown my weird hobby of taking pictures of various types of mushrooms in the wild has its own niche community out there. I've found that the enough of the infosec community have moved over that I can still follow along.</p>\n<p>But most of all I've discovered that the toxicity was a generated feature of twitter, not necessarily of its users. I don't think my interests have changed over the past few months to the point that I'd err towards an entirely different crowd of people. And yet my feed isn't a dumpster fire of hatred and aggression.</p>\n<p>The algorithm on twitter that was curating my feed was doing a cracking job of making sure that I was an old man shouting at clouds. Over things - again - that didn't affect me and that didn't need my ire.</p>\n<p>Mastodon feels experimental - not only as a technology - but also a revitalisation of a means of communicating with other people with civility, grace, and good humour. </p>\n<p>One user posted the following and the brilliance of it took a little while to sink in for me, but really does cut to the crux of the matter:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tech.lgbt/@laurakm/109370867899322648\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"Mastodon has changed how I think. Twitter now seems like a server that doesn't want to federate with anyone else, and that everyone else has blacklisted. I'm in awe of how much sense that makes.\"</a></p>",

It's a big ask of myself and whilst it was going well to start with, I've seemingly gotten myself stuck and can't find a way out.</p>\n<p>The story element to this project was written first. And that's more or less done. A couple of people have reviewed it for me and I've tweaked bits and pieces, but it's basically finished.</p>\n<p>The music element of it though - which was always going to be the hardest work - has come to a complete standstill.</p>\n<p>I was well underway with 2 of the tracks (of probably 9 in total) but I lost my creative streak and have found it tough to get back into it. Worse, in the time that it's taken me to come back round to it, I've lost the thread that I was working on and I don't really like what I've done or where it was going anymore.</p>\n<p>And so the music part is more or less back at square one.</p>\n<p>The artwork had a few high level ideas created using an AI, but I haven't really touched that. This part is not a surprise though - I've got the least skill and experience in this stuff so I expected it to be last.</p>\n<p>Why am I stuck with the music though?</p>\n<p>We ran competitions amongst friends during lockdown where we'd take a theme and dedicate a small amount of time to it - usually a week or two weeks. At the end of this period the idea was that you presented what you had. This was a huge motivator because the finite time meant that you couldn't mañana it - it had to be started right now - and the other driver was that there was nowhere near enough time to make it \"perfect\" - you just had to make it \"good enough\".</p>\n<p>I think this is where I've come unstuck with my project. I know that I've got as long as I want because I've no committed external deadline. I also know that I need to make it \"perfect\" - otherwise what's the point.</p>\n<p>And so I find myself creatively stuck. I don't really have the time to spare - particularly not to reach such a high bar (\"perfect\") and so I simply let it lapse.</p>\n<p>It's probably pretty obvious what frustrates me here: it's not the work, it's not even the problem. It's the fact that I know the solution and yet I still procrastinate.</p>\n<p>In a work context we've solved this using Agile sprints and the idea of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). We've got 2 weeks sprints that set a series of interim deadlines and we've got a built in acceptance that we're not aiming for perfect - MVPs.</p>\n<p>If someone at work came to me with this problem I'd probably say something about \"perfect being the enemy of progress\" and then help them structure what they were doing into the relevant sprints and break it down into achieveable tasks.</p>\n<p>But here I sit with my very own personal version of the same problem and a whole raft of proven solutions that for some reason I can't turn into results.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Context switching - jumping between multiple tasks - is one of the things that I seek to protect my teams from. It is pretty commonly derided as a \"productivity killer\" and having been in various jobs that have demanded it I can attest to the effort that it requires to maintain for too long. And how close to the dreaded \"burn out\" you can get with it.</p>\n<p>But I've recently discovered that my job as a leader is actually all about context switching. And yet I don't feel dangerously close to burning out. What gives?</p>\n<p>I think the difference is the level of detail that we need to engage at. As an architect I was necessarily down in the detail. My job was to understand the detail of what was happening so that I could come up with viable designs, identify key risks, and enable informed decision-making.</p>\n<p>Context switching in detail comes with a huge overhead of having to get back into the detail of each new task. None of it is cursory - it's all detail work. And that process of getting back into the detail is the bit that I think constitutes the \"overhead\". I can't do the work until the overhead is covered - which takes time. So if I have to switch contexts too ofthen then all I'm doing is processing overhead and never making real progress.</p>\n<p>Now though, in my role as a leader, I've had to accept due to the scale of what my teams are involved in, being over all the detail is impossible. This was a difficult adjustment but probably a whole other blog post for another day. So, lacking that detail my need to process the overhead is a function of how well my teams are operating. I don't need the detail because I know that I've got good people who do have it. And one of the key skills that my teams need is being able to summarise their positions when they need support.</p>\n<p>I've switched out detail for context.</p>\n<p>And I think that's what makes the difference to why context switching isn't problematic and is, in fact, my job.</p>\n<p>Provided I've got people that I know are dealing with the detail. And provided I know that they can summarise to me their requirements and situations. And provided that I'm sufficiently aware of the moving parts, I can forgo the detail and context switch without burden.</p>",

The guy making my lunch is quite lazy which often results in my eating crisp butties, but I think he's distracted with another job so I try to go easy on him.</p>\n<p>The office is far away. Coffee, although subsidised (and pretty decent) is a bit pricier than 17p a cup, and to be honest the monitor situation is a bit hit and miss, despite the heavy investment in a lovely new building. But there is a Juici Sushi and the GLC just round the corner and I don't even think they serve crisp butties.</p>\n<p>I'm lucky that my company have been employee-focused over the past couple of horrific years and they've been incredibly protective of us and shown a huge amount of flexibility.</p>\n<p>I remember our CEO talking early into the COVID nonsense about how he was certain that we needed to be in the office as this was our \"secret sauce\" but then as this looked less and less feasible, we pivoted and adopted a home-first strategy.</p>\n<p>An accident of timing meant that we were leaving a brand-new office basically empty for the most part, but everyone understood that it was the right choice for the time.</p>\n<p>As we've emerged from the worst of COVID there's been a slow return to the office - again on very flexible terms, but it's fair to say that I don't think the uptake has been huge.</p>\n<p>I'm guilty of taking the easy commute option too often. But equally I've been stung a few times when I've arranged to meet people and it has been cancelled at the last minute. My commute isn't cheap (in money or time-elapsed) but is usually worth it to get to spend some real face time with people. It's less beneficial for me to travel the 90 minutes to the office to spend 8 hours on Zoom calls whilst sat alone, and then commute home.</p>\n<p>And herein lies the difficulty - giving people flexibility seems like the obvious and right choice, but the difficultly comes when you're trying to co-ordinate getting groups and teams together. When everyone is flexible then it's hard to make and stick to firm plans.</p>\n<p>There are clear benefits from being together face to face. I wouldn't like to have planned a few of our recent projects entirely remotely, nor would having 'Zoom Beers' have been as intangibly beneficial as sitting outside a pub near the train station in the sun putting the world to rights whilst waiting for the train. </p>\n<p>So what is the answer? Everyone back in the office? Hope that technology somehow continues to improve remote working to the point that it is really like being in each other's company?</p>\n<p>I don't know. </p>\n<p>I'd like to spend time with my teams more often. I'd like to have more team meetings in a real room together. I'd like to solve minor problems over a coffee (or whilst waiting for a coffee) instead of in a Zoom meeting (in mandatory 30 minute increments). I'd like to catch someone whilst passing their desk and realise something obvious that had previously evaded me. Maybe this is what was meant by \"secret sauce\".</p>\n<p>But I also like my home commute, coffee, and crisp-butties. And I love having my dog with me too.</p>\n<p>I don't know. It's quite hard. But it feels like something has to change.</p>",
