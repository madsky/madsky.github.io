It's easy to get it wrong and the whole thing can sound disjointed and cynical. I've heard a bunch of those bands over the years. But this group nails the mix, moving between styles and sounds in a really organic (🤮) and accomplished way.</p>\n<p>It looks like they've got a bit to chew through so I'm going to dive into their back catalogue.</p>\n<p>I see that they're tagged as \"prog\", but I'm going to pretend I don't read that because the problem with prog is that it eventually \"progresses\" beyond where I'm interested.

I've also been watching their hype on socials around filming for the release.</p>\n<p>I tend to only graze pre-release singles because I feel like they're lacking the context of the album. I imagine it's a tricky game to pick your pre-release too - you want something that you consider to be one of the better tracks so you can showcase what you've done, but you don't want to release your <em>best</em> tracks because it should only be whetting the appetite.</p>\n<p>Without the full album wrapper it feels lost to me, and so I wait.</p>\n<p>Yesterday I gave this its first full spin. Admittedly in the car with other people, so it didn't have my full attention. But my day hadn't allowed a gap to listen properly and I wasn't going to not play it on release date!</p>\n<p>My very high level first pass is that this is going to be awesome.</p>\n<p>Christina's vocals are on point - as are Andrea's new heavier death growls that we got to enjoy on Comalies XX. The compositions sound interesting - soaring sections, brutal passages, and strong interplay. The mix sounds fuller with more presence from the guitars and rhythm section. It feels like they're back to courting a more alt/metal fanbase whereas some of their previous outtings felt like they were aimed at people with more of a pop sensibility in their structures.</p>\n<p>I have the vinyl on order from my local record shop so I'm looking forward to a more detailed listen once that pops up, but in the meantime this is a record I'll be spending a bunch of time with. I'm sincerely hoping that this has a reception similar to, or better than, Comalies had for them back in 2002.</p>",

I don't even go to the \"trouble\" of putting a tracker on any of the pages. I don't invite comments or interaction. So why do I do it? The linked article is an excellent summary of a lot of the reasons.</p>\n<p>A long, long time ago I used to blog little technical solutions I'd found and I had trackers on the blog. There was a pretty constant but very low stream of people coming to my blog from search engines because I had solved the exact problem they had. </p>\n<p>This trickle of people didn't make any dfference to my life - I was blogging anyway, and these were just by-products of my writing down my tech solutions and insights.</p>\n<p>One day, much later, I wrote up my reverse engineering of some malware and that got some serious traffic. It does still get consistent traffic today for some reason. But you know what? It changed nothing in my life.</p>\n<p>I also wrote something about \"identity theft\" and submitted it to HackerNews - it went to the front page. It received an obscene amount of traffic and a good set of interactions. But you know what? It changed nothing in my life.</p>\n<p>I then went through a period of self hosting where I blogged quite a lot about my interests but I lost most of the content in my endless shuffling of platforms. During this period I also stopped adding trackers to my blogs. I can't remember if there was a \"why\", I just stopped.</p>\n<p>And I still blog. I do it \"blindly\" to whether it's consumed or not. Occasionally someone I know mentions that they've seen somedthing I've written (not entirely sure how or why since I don't promote it) and we talk about it. But you know what? It changed nothing in my life.</p>\n<p>I still blog. Maybe a bit less than I want to, but I still do it. In a subtle way, removing the tracker code turned out to be a poignant moment - it's when I (possibly without planning) switched from external validation of my efforts to write stuff (clicks, reads, viewers) to internal validation (\"I wrote it because I wanted to\").</p>\n<p><em>(One thing I remember is that I briefly considered chucking my talking points into an LLM so that I could make sure \"I\" was churning out as much \"content\" as possible. What hubris! And what a close call with adding to the cancer of the modern internet.)</em></p>\n<p>That internal validation is a much cleaner way of living; it changes the pace of what I'm doing. If I don't blog, fine. If I do blog, fine. Is it poorly written? Fine. Is it so beautifully written that it's going to get me plaudits? Yeah, sure it is. But I wrote it and the act of writing - as the linked blog says - </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you write, you think better.

And it usually boils down to this: <em>would you mind doing my job for me?</em></p>\n<p>What do I mean by this?</p>\n<p>Let's look at the cold-contact scenario, wherein I don't have a relationship with this person. They've usually bought my phone number from some scummy aggregator (spoiler: we will never do business in this scenario), or messaged me on Linked In.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Them: this is our super amazing product ... can we arrange a demo?</p>\n<p>Me: sorry, this isn't in my remit/isn't a priority now/isn't interesting to me</p>\n<p>Them: who can I speak to then?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now usually I end the conversation there and we'll never talk again. But I've tried to be less angry and short with people over the past few months because I feel it making me calloused in real life and so, sometimes, if I think there's a possibility that this product or service might actually be interesting to someone else I might suggest they contact them on Linked In to let them decide. This has proven to always be a mistake.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Me: you could contact John Smith/Jane Doe</p>\n<p>Them: can you give me their email address and phone number?</p>\n<p>Me: No, use Linked In</p>\n<p>Them: Ok, can you contact them and ask them to reply/say how much you recommend us?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And here we arrive at my point: I am now to make a sales pitch on your behalf, for a product I don't want, to someone you don't know. I'm now here to do your job. You've cold-recruited me to do your job for you.</p>\n<p>And a little later on...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Them: I didn't hear back from John Smith/Jane Doe, could you follow up with them for me? / Could the 3 of us jump on a quick intro call?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I do not work for you and I am not interested in selling your product. When you get to this point in the conversation with me you've now made an enemy of me, and you've made it so that even if you did happen to turn up one day selling the exact thing I needed, we're still not talking.</p>\n<p>The next scenario is found where I'm actively engaging suppliers and we're already in conversations about their products. I've been really clear that we're interested, we've talked about the problem that I want to solve and we've talked about how I think their product or service might help me.</p>\n<p>As this conversation develops, in nearly all recent cases involving US-based firms, we get to the point where they're having me dictate their sales deck to them so that they can send it to me as some kind of leverage.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Them: and what would you say is the main reason you want our product?</p>\n<p>Them: and what else is important to you about our product?</p>\n<p>Them: and what would be the consequence of not getting our product?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I see what you're doing. It's the establishment of the business case for their product, by me, in my own words, and the subtle replacement of my business case to solve my problem, with this one I just created. And because I had a hand in creating it, it's much more important to me than if it were just sent to me (\"The Ikea effect\"). So if I'm not on-guard, wise to - and bored of - this approach you'll catch me out and I'll be singing your company song by the end of the week.</p>\n<p>So again we're at the point where I'm doing your work for you. I'm writing your business case for my buying your product.</p>",

Who was in power in 2015, out of interest?</li>\n<li>Labour are supporting a local enquiry - as was conducted in Telford and Rotherham.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like I said, close to the truth, but wide of the mark.</p>\n<p>But where is this all coming from?</p>\n<p>It's no secret that the press in the UK is heavily right-leaning. The right will decry the \"liberal media\" but there are only a handful of sources of liberal mainstream media, with every other mainstream source solidly on the right.</p>\n<p>And as we find ourselves with the first Labour government in 14 years - with the Conservative party in active meltdown, challenged from Farage, Musk, et al - there's a frantic drive to discredit everything Labour says (or doesn't say), or does (or doesn't do).</p>\n<p>I do wonder if there's something more pernicious beneath it all, but it feels like I'd be going down a rabbit hole that is going to need much more time and research so I'm leaving this alone for now.</p>",

Wayfarer - Brudenell Social Club, Leeds</p>\n<p>It will come as no surprise that in a year when Wayfarer were touring my favourite gig that year was going to be Wayfarer. I've been obsessed with these guys for over a decade and last year when I finally got to see them live was amazing.</p>\n<p>This year they were back with another album and a much extended touring schedule.</p>\n<p>As we were queueing to get in I noticed that some of the band were getting changed in a van right next to us. It sheds a light on how unglamourous an industry this can be that these guys from Denver, Colorado who are touring Europe basically live out of the back of a Transit van for the duration.</p>\n<p>I chatted with Jamie (bass, vocals) and Joey (lead guitar) for a few minutes before their set - given the pedestal I hold these guys up on, it still amazes me to this day that they're just chilling at the back of the venue and I can wander up and say hi.</p>\n<p>The sound mix at Brudenell was incredible. My favourite sound set-up by a long-shot. Wayfarer played a relatively short set (opening for Svalbard and Enslaved) but covered a lot of ground from their new record. </p>\n<p>It was at this gig that I really came to realise just how much work Joey is putting in on lead throughout the songs. On the surface the songs have a nice set of riffs and breaks, but when you get the mix right (and you can see him playing it!) you realise that the texture beneath those riffs is a rich tapestry.</p>\n<p>Afterwards I was waiting for my mate Paul in the corridor and Shane (guitar, vocals) came walking out and recognised me from the previous year in Manchester! We chatted for a while and he was joined by Joey before they headed out for some food. Last year I was a bit deer-in-the-headlights starstruck when I met them, but this year I almost managed to come across as a normal human.</p>\n<p>Great gig. Great band. Great venue.</p>\n<p>2. Tool - AO Arena, Manchester</p>\n<p>I'd given up hope of getting tickets for the show when I'd logged on and seen that they were going for £300+ each. I like Tool a lot, but I also like paying my mortgage. Eventually though, for some reason, a batch of more reasonably priced tickets came available - albeit sat up in the Gods - and I managed to snag a couple of me and Marc.</p>\n<p>We knew how high up the arena we were so I don't think we were expecting too much but incredibly the seats were pretty much perfect. More or less central at the back, we got a great spot for the spectacular light show that accompanied the gig.</p>\n<p>Tool were tight and machine-like as you'd expect. Given the complexity of what they do musically they alwasys amaze me.</p>\n<p>It seemed like there were two different entities on stage though - Maynard James Keenan, and then the band. Whilst this had no discernable impact on the music they played, save for a perfunctory coming-together at the end of the set they seemed comfortable in being separate. The band all hugged it out and thanked the crowd whereas MJK thanked everyone and left the band to enjoy their applause.</p>\n<p>This gig helped me towards the realisation that I'm not really a 'stadium tour' kind of concert go-er anymore. Amazing as they were, being one of 50,000 or so just seems a bit empty. I don't begrudge them (or anyone else) their success at being able to fill venues like this, but I don't think they're for me anymore.</p>\n<p>Still, amazing band, clinical execution, and a fantastic gig.</p>\n<p>3. Lacuna Coil - Academy, Manchester</p>\n<p>I was never a part of the goth scene back in the day. I was more traditional metal - jeans and t-shirt kind of guy, whereas the goth scene seemed a bit higher maintenance, fashion-wise. We used to pop in to the 'goth room' in Jilly's occasionally and whilst you'd occasionally get some real bangers in there, it always felt like it was someone else's room and you should get back to the warm beer and moshing in the main room.</p>\n<p>Lacuna Coil were one of the bands that did enter fairly regular rotation for me back then, and Comalies in particular (their breakthrough album) became a solid favourite for me.</p>\n<p>Weirdly in all the time since then I'd never seen them live, which is a bit weird when I think about it, so when the opportunity came to go see them with Russell I jumped at it.</p>\n<p>And what a gig it was too. The band were tight and heavy and Andrea and Cristina were absolutely incredible. I'm pretty sure Cristina is in her fifties now but she was absolutely belting out the tunes and made it look effortless.</p>\n<p>With the re-issue of Comalies as the heavier, slightly re-imagined, Comalies XX their sound has taken on a more modern metal edge and it works.</p>\n<p>A really high energy gig with really big nostalgia value for me. I'm looking forward to seeing them again next year when they drop their new album.</p>\n<p>4. Wayfarer - Club Academy, Manchester</p>\n<p>Back in the day, Club Academy was my venue of choice. I saw post-metal masters Isis there a long time ago and the sound was unrivaled. So I was really looking forward to catching Wayfarer here to bring it home.</p>\n<p>Phil came with me to this one - fair to say that he wasn't 'a fan' going into the gig but was pretty impressed and enjoyed it.</p>\n<p>Whilst the band played another great set (Leeds was the night before!) I felt like the venue let them down a bit. Joey was hidden in the mix and the clean vocals from Shane were too low as well.</p>\n<p>Ultimately it didn't make a jot of difference for me as I was in my element rocking out nonetheless!</p>\n<p>It was much more apparent when listening to Enslaved later on. Whereas at Brudenell their rhythm section was clear and tight, here it was muddy and ill-defined. A shame really.</p>\n<p>Phil and I bumped into the guys from Wode and had a chat with them. They were putting up Wayfarer for the past couple of nights in the area. They'd opened for Wayfarer last yeat at the Star and Garter. Turns out - which I'd totally forgotten - that when we, Omens, played our gig a decade earlier we were actually opening for Wode! Small world and I'm officially just 1 degree of separation away from Wayfarer!</p>\n<p>5. Torpor - Peer Hat, Manchester</p>\n<p>I'd not heard of Torpor before this gig and I was invited along by Phil. It's weird because having listened to them now, they fit nicely in my post-metal / sludge tastes, and I think I would have enjoyed them a lot.</p>\n<p>I'm writing in the past tense because this was the 'farewell' tour of the Bristol trio.</p>\n<p>The Peer Hat is a venue I'd never heard of either. A tiny pub with a basement in the back of the Northern Quarter. It didn't look like it could really hold a crowd.</p>\n<p>As we left the gig we talked about the reality of the metal scene, particularly with bands playing in niche genres like Torpor. For their farewell tour, after a decade or more at it, they only turned out about 30 people in Manchester. But I guess that is the gig - if you're playing for money and fame then you're probably best not focusing on 'existential sludge/post doom' and maybe looking at weddings and parties instead.</p>\n<p>These guys were clearly doing it for the love of the magnificent noise they were creating. And to be honest, if I could turn out 30 people interested in listening to me play the noise I'd created then I'd be pretty chuffed too. Even if it meant I had to get up for work the next morning.</p>",
