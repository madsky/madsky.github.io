What on earth was this? My initial guess was that it was avant-garde metal - i.e., not interested in your rules. Maybe crossed with some really pugilistic death metal or hardcore.</p><p>I then relaxed into it being definitely black metal, but maybe with a bit of an avant-garde edge.</p><p>But then this thing just kept evolving. And evolving in a way that, whilst I couldn't predict what would happen next, I found myself feeling <em>comfortable</em> in its eclectic mix of polished, chaotic warmth.</p><p>And that's a bit special. It's a very warm and weirdly welcoming record. I can't quite put my finger on why this works but something like <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/artist/sikth/61004133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sikth</a> never really gelled with me. Or why the chaotic unpredictability of this is somehow joyous, whereas <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/artist/sikth/61004133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unexpect</a> was just ... <em>obtuse</em>.</p><p>The best summary I could come up with was </p><blockquote><p>somehow simultaneously more than black metal and also not black metal. Whilst being totally black metal.</p></blockquote><p>And that's where I'll leave it, I think, except to say: this is a great album and each time I hear it, I like it a little bit more.</p><p><a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/the-spiritual-sound/1821247551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Spiritual Sound, by Agriculture.</a></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on Thursday, 8 January 2026</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://madsky.github.io/tags/2026/">2026</a></li><li><a href="https://madsky.github.io/tags/album-review/">Album Review</a></li><li><a href="https://madsky.github.io/tags/music/">Music</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://madsky.github.io/media/website/author.png" loading="lazy" alt="Leigh"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://madsky.github.io/authors/leigh/" class="invert" rel="author">Leigh</a></h3><p>Father, Husband, Guitar player, Piano-learner, Xbox-player, Metal-listener, infosec leader WIP.</p></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://madsky.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://madsky.github.io/2025-in-review.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> 2025 In Review</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-03-08T10:26" class="feed__date">Saturday, 8 March 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://madsky.github.io/firstlisten-bioluminescence-by-dawn-of-ouroboros.html" class="invert">#FirstListen Bioluminescence by Dawn of Ouroboros</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-02-15T10:26" class="feed__date">Saturday, 15 February 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://madsky.github.io/firstlisten-sleepless-empire-by-lacuna-coil.html" class="invert">#FirstListen Sleepless Empire by Lacuna Coil</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-01-25T14:41" class="feed__date">Saturday, 25 January 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://madsky.github.io/firstlisten-passages-ep-by-sunrot.html" class="invert">#FirstListen: Passages EP by Sunrot</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://madsky.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
